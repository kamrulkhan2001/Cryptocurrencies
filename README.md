# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview

For this project, we created a report that using unsupervised machine learning to group cryptocurrencies and create a classification system in order to review the investment portfolio.

## Results

We used the unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithm using the steps below:

Preprocessed the cryptocurrency data for PCA.
Reduced the data dimensions using PCA.
Used K-means for clustering cryptocurrencies.
Visualized the results with 3D-scatter graph and hvplot scatter graph.
